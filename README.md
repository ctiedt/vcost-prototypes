# Video Conference Soundtrack Prototypes

This repository contains my prototypes and documentation from the Sonic Thinking and Neurodesign Lecture classes
at Hasso Plattner Institute in the winter term 2021/2022.

My project evaluated the idea of adding music to video conferences to enhance the empathy between participants.

## Contents

- [Prototype 0](vcost-prototype-0/): My first prototype, generating music on the fly using the `music21` package
- [Prototype 1](vcost-prototype-1/): My second prototype, using pre-recorded music segments for different moods
- [Prototype 2](vcost-prototype-2/): The final prototype of this semester, using a multithreaded approach
  to eliminate gaps between emotion recognition and music playback.
- [Documentation](documentation/): The presentations from class and bibliography
